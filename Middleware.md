## Middleware

Middleware is a function that runs between a client's request and the server's response. It can perform actions such as modifying requests, validating data, handling authentication, or logging. Essentially, middleware acts as a bridge to process requests before they reach the final route or response.

## __dirname

`__dirname` is a built-in Node.js variable that provides the absolute path of the current folder where the executing file resides. It is useful for locating files, managing paths, and working with static resources within a project.

## Body Parser

Body Parser is a component in Node.js (built into Express) that allows the server to read and process data sent in the request body, typically from POST requests. It converts incoming request data into a format that can be easily used within the server, such as JSON or URL-encoded data.
